					Campuses are the ideal location to reach one of the most notorious audiences in advertising: gen z. Between heading to class and socializing
					with friends, these young adults spend a significant amount of time on campus. And with screens strategically installed in high-trafficked
					areas, campuses are an ideal location for lifestyle, entertainment and food brands to share their marketing messages with a captive
					audience.
